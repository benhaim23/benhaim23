## About Me  
I'm a crypto-native researcher, builder, and data analyst passionate about telling the story behind the numbers. Whether it's tokenizing real-world assets, forecasting Bitcoin with neural networks, or helping institutions enter DeFi‚ÄîI love turning on-chain complexity into clarity.

I currently lead strategy and research at **3iQ**, where I work on everything from lending frameworks and RWA tokenization to deep-dive research across DeFi, staking, and Web3 infrastructure. Before that, I co-founded an NFT studio that drove over $4M in revenue in its first year.

I thrive where data meets narrative, and I bring that energy to every project, product, and partnership I‚Äôm a part of.
